# Climate data analysis and Flask API creation utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask in Python 

## Project Description:
Through utilizing SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Flask API, this project serves to provide a climate analysis on Honolulu, Hawaii. Then, a Flask API was designed based on the developed queries. A precipitation and station analysis was performed to answer the following:

- Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

- Design a query to find the most-active stations.

- Design a query that calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperatures that filters on the most-active station id found in the previous query.

- Design a query to get the previous 12 months of temperature observation data.
